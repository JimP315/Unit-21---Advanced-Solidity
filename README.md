### I found this exercise difficult at the end, due to the fact that the connection of Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache seems to have an order that I didnt really work out.  I realise I will probably get an incomplete here, but now that I have to move onto my final project, I am happy to accept whatever grade comes on this one.
